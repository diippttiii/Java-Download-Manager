OVERVIEW:
The Download Manager is a Java-based application designed to streamline and prioritize file downloads from the internet. By categorizing downloads and assigning priority levels, users can efficiently manage multiple files, ensuring that critical downloads are completed promptly. This tool offers flexibility for handling both high-priority and less urgent tasks, making it a valuable asset for efficient file management.
Why Use This Download Manager?
In many situations, users might need to download multiple files from the internet, but not all files are equally important. For instance, a user might need to download software updates immediately, while downloading a large video file might not be as urgent. This tool addresses the need for managing such scenarios by:

Prioritizing Downloads: Higher-priority files are downloaded first, reducing waiting time for critical files.
Categorizing Files: Helps in organizing and managing files based on categories, such as "Software," "Documents," "Media," etc.
Queue Management: Efficiently manages downloads, preventing bottlenecks and ensuring that files are downloaded in an orderly fashion.
